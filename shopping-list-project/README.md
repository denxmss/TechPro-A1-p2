Title: Shopping List Project
Description: this program we made is a shopping list program that allows the code to:

-Enter up to 5 shopping items

-Count and Store the items in an array of strings with a fixed size of 5

-Display the complete shopping list once input is finished

-Allow the user to search for a specific item in the list.

-Provide feedback if the searched item is found or not
